I developed this project while taking Data Focused Python during my Masters program at Carnegie Mellon University. It utilizes the Zillow API, the U.S. Census API, and USDA CSV exports to build visualizations that illustrate the correlations between socioeconomic influences and real estate metrics across several U.S. cities with varying demographics.
